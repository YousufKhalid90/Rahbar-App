# Rahbar - Mental Health Support Mobile App
Project Duration: June 2023 - August 2023
Developed By: Muhammad Yousuf Khalid during Internship at Creative Chaos

# Project Overview
Rahbar is a mobile application designed to connect users with mental health professionals. The app provides a platform for users to receive motivational content, access mental health-related articles, and schedule therapy sessions with professionals. It ensures a smooth user experience through features like social login, real-time chat, and session management.

# Features
# 1. User Onboarding
First-Time User Experience: A tutorial is shown to first-time users to guide them through the app's features.

Login State Management: Implemented using shared preferences to determine whether the tutorial should be shown or if the user should be taken directly to the login screen.
# 2. Social Login
Integration: Simplified user onboarding through firebase social login APIs, allowing users to sign in using their social media accounts.
# 3. Motivational Quotes
Dynamic Content: The homepage displays motivational quotes that change every time the user opens the app. These quotes are fetched from a RESTful API.
# 4. Mental Health Articles
Curated Content: The app provides users with mental health-related articles accessible from the homepage. These articles are also retrieved via a RESTful API.
# 5. Scheduling Therapy Sessions
Category Selection: Users can select the category of mental health they need assistance with.

Session Plans implemented using In-App Purchase: Users can choose between a 15-minute free chat, a 25-minute paid session, or a 60-minute premium session.

Push-Notifications: Once a session is scheduled, the user receives a notification saying "Finding Therapist."
# 6. Real-Time Chat
Chat Functionality: Once a therapist accepts the session, both the user and therapist are directed to a real-time chat.

Chat Timer: The chat includes a timer that is visible to the user only in the last 10 minutes of the session but is visible to the therapist throughout.

Session History: All chat sessions are stored in Firebase, maintaining a history for future reference.
# 7. Therapist App
Online/Offline Toggle: Therapists can toggle their availability status.

Request Notifications: Therapists receive notifications when a user requests a session.

Session Management: Once a therapist accepts a session, they won't receive new session requests until the current session is completed.
# 8. UI/UX Design
Design Implementation: The appâ€™s UI/UX was implemented based on designs provided by the design team, ensuring a seamless user experience.
# Tech Stack
Frontend: Flutter

Backend: Firebase Firestore for real-time chat and session history
